# SwiftTalk: A Simple iOS Messaging App

This a personal project that I use to expand my skills and knowledge. The primary goal behind this project was to further strengthen my skills in Firebase and iOS development while acquiring new skills along the way. It provides an opportunity to explore and experiment with cutting-edge technologies, all while creating a functional and enjoyable app.

## Features:

- **SwiftUI UI**: The app is designed using SwiftUI, Apple's modern and intuitive framework for building user interfaces.

- **Firebase Authentication**: Securely sign in and sign up with Firebase Authentication, ensuring your data and identity are safe.

- **Firebase Firestore**: SwiftTalk relies on Firebase Firestore to store the chats, ensuring your messages are always available and up-to-date.

- **Firebase Storage**: Profile pictures are stored securely with Firebase Storage, so you can personalize your experience with ease.

- **MVVM Design Pattern**: SwiftTalk is built following the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, keeping the codebase organized and maintainable.

- **Kingfisher Image Loading**: I use Kingfisher to download and cache profile images, providing a smooth user experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with SwiftTalk, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. **Important**: Since I have removed the Firebase `Info.plist` file for security reasons, you'll need to set up your Firebase project and create your own `Info.plist` file. Don't worry, it's easy to do!
3. Open the project in Xcode.
4. Build and run the app on your iOS device or simulator.

Feel free to explore, customize, and enhance SwiftTalk to your heart's content. I hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed creating it.
